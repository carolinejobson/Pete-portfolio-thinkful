# Thinkful Assessment: Build Your Portfolio Web Page

Pete-portfolio-thinkful is a basic, one-page website. 

# Project Description
Pete Thinkful, an artist, has approached your team to help him build a web portfolio to serve as his online business card. The designer on your team provided the following user interface mockup.

In this project, you will translate the design above into HTML and CSS code.

# Prerequisites
Your first task is to complete the HTML code for Pete's portfolio page. Then you will style the page with CSS. Next, you will use a HTML validator to verify the HTML page for syntax errors. Finally, you will display your work on GitHub.io.

# Semantic Page Scaffolding
You should use the header and nav semantic containers to create the header and navigation bar, respectively. Each navigation link (About, Portfolio, and Contact) should be an anchor element. Complete the Portfolio, Contact, and Footer sections, too.

# Additional HTML5 Requirements
1. Pete's image can be found in the images/ folder, titled pete-thinkful.png. You should set the alt text of the image element to Pete Thinkful.
2. Pressing the About navigation link should take the site visitor to the About section.
3. In the "Please feel free to take a look at my website and feel free to contact me." text, the "contact me" part should be a link that, when pressed, takes the site visitor to the Contact section of the page.
4. "Producing abstract art," "Creating street graffiti art," and "Connecting with like-minded artists" should be displayed as a bulleted list.
5. Pressing the Contact navigation link should take the site visitor to the Contact section.
6. "LinkedIn," "Instagram," and "Pinterest" should be displayed as a numbered list of anchor elements. The href values may be left empty.
7. The About, Hi! I'm Pete Thinkful, and Pete's Background headings, as well as Pete's image, should be horizontally centered on the page.
8. The About heading should use a larger font size than the Hi! I'm Pete Thinkful and Pete's Background subheadings.
9. Pete's image should be completely round and have a border that is 2px wide with a color of #003049. 

# Styling the Web Page
Now that you have completed the HTML for the page, it's time to style the page, section by section. You will implement the remainder of the CSS to achieve the design shown in the mock, as detailed below.

# Additional CSS Requirements
1. The styling requirements for the Portfolio section are as follows:
2. The Portfolio heading, project name (such as Abstract Red), and project image should be horizontally centered on the page.
3. The Portfolio heading should use a larger font size than the project names.
4. The Contact heading should be horizontally centered on the page.
5. The background color of the page should be set to #eae2b7.
6. The contents of the header and the footer should be horizontally centered on the page.
7. Anchor tags should have a color of #d62828. On hover, they should change their color to #f77f00.

# Validating the HTML
Now, you will use an HTML validator to validate your web page. An HTML validator is a quality-assurance tool that can detect common syntax errors such as extra spaces, open tags, or missing quotation marks. These syntax errors could cause a page to render correctly in one browser but not in another. You can use an HTML validator to automatically verify your HTML page for syntax errors. You can then correct any coding mistakes identified by the validator program.

# Display the Web Page on GitHub.io
Now, you will display your work on GitHub.io so that Pete can view the finished product and provide feedback.
